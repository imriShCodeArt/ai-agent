  - [ ] Configure Psalm settings
  - [ ] Run parallel analysis with PHPStan
  - [ ] Fix Psalm-specific issues

- [ ] **Configure PHPCS with WordPress standards**
  - [ ] Update `phpcs.xml.dist` with WPCS rules
  - [ ] Fix all coding standard violations
  - [ ] Add custom sniff rules if needed
  - [ ] Set up automated fixing where possible

- [ ] **Set up pre-commit hooks**
  - [ ] Install pre-commit framework
  - [ ] Configure hooks for PHPStan, PHPCS, tests
  - [ ] Add commit message validation
  - [ ] Test hook functionality

### Security Hardening Tasks

#### 1.2.2 Security Audit & Hardening
- [ ] **Conduct security scan**
  - [ ] Run security analysis tools
  - [ ] Review for SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Check for XSS prevention measures
  - [ ] Validate input sanitization

- [ ] **Implement security best practices**
  - [ ] Add nonce verification for forms
  - [ ] Implement capability checks
  - [ ] Sanitize all user inputs
  - [ ] Escape all outputs

### Quality Rules & Standards
- **Static Analysis**: Zero errors in PHPStan level 8
- **Code Style**: 100% WPCS compliance
- **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities in security scan
- **Performance**: No performance regressions

### Definition of Done
- [ ] PHPStan level 8 passes with zero errors
- [ ] PHPCS reports zero violations
- [ ] Security scan shows no critical issues
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits
- [ ] Security documentation updated

**Timeline**: Week 2  
**Owner**: Development Team  

### Documentation Tasks

#### 1.3.1 Complete PHPDoc Coverage
- [ ] **Document all public methods**
  - [ ] Add PHPDoc blocks to all public methods
  - [ ] Include parameter types and descriptions
  - [ ] Document return types and exceptions
  - [ ] Add `@since` tags for version tracking

- [ ] **Add usage examples**
