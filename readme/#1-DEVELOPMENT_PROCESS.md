# WP AI Agent Plugin - Development Process & Guidelines

## üéØ Overall Objectives

The WP AI Agent plugin aims to create a **secure, auditable, and controllable AI agent** that can perform CRUD operations on WordPress entities while maintaining strict governance, security, and review workflows. The plugin supports three operational modes:

1. **Suggest Mode**: AI proposes changes, humans apply them
2. **Review Mode**: AI creates drafts/revisions, humans approve/reject
3. **Autonomous Mode**: AI executes within defined guardrails and policies

### Core Principles
- **Security First**: Every action is capability-checked and policy-validated
- **Audit Everything**: All operations are logged with before/after states
- **Human Oversight**: Review workflows prevent unauthorized changes
- **Graceful Degradation**: Plugin works even when AI services are unavailable
- **WordPress Native**: Leverages WordPress APIs, revisions, and security models

## üèóÔ∏è Development Culture & Standards

### Code Quality Standards
- **PHP 8.1+** with strict typing enabled
- **WordPress Coding Standards** (WPCS) compliance
- **PSR-4** autoloading and **PSR-12** coding style

  - Focus on domain entities, value objects, and business rules
- **Unit tests** for all business logic
- **Integration tests** for WordPress hooks and APIs
- **End-to-end tests** for critical user workflows
- **Performance tests** for database operations

### Documentation Requirements
