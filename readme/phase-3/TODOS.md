# Phase 3: Advanced Security & Policy Engine TODOs

**Timeline**: Weeks 5-6  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Priority**: Critical

## Overview
Elevate security and governance: richer policy rules, stronger authentication and rate limiting, and comprehensive auditability. Build on Phase 2‚Äôs foundations (LLM + tools + policy checks).

## üîê 3.1 Policy Engine Enhancement
**Owner**: Backend Team  
**Timeline**: Week 5

### Core Tasks
- [x] Time-based restrictions (working hours, blackout windows)
- [x] Content filtering (regex, blocked terms lists, severity levels)
- [x] Rate limiting per user/IP/tool
- [x] Approval workflows (multi-step, per tool/entity)
- [x] Policy versioning (persisted snapshots + diff)

### Implementation Notes
- [x] Extend `Policy` to evaluate new rule blocks
- [x] Persist policy documents in DB with migration
- [x] Expose admin UI endpoints (later wired in Phase 5)

### Testing
- [x] Unit: each rule block with allow/deny cases
- [x] Policy diff/version retrieval tests
- [x] Rate-limit boundary tests (hour/day)

## üõ°Ô∏è 3.2 Security Hardening
**Owner**: Backend + DevOps  
**Timeline**: Week 6

### Core Tasks
- [x] Application passwords for service accounts
- [x] Optional OAuth2 integration (scoped tokens)
- [x] HMAC signing for webhook/execute endpoints
- [x] Rate limiting + DDoS protection (server/WAF notes)

### Implementation Notes
- [x] Add signing/verification middleware for critical routes
- [x] Store secrets via WP options with sanitization + capabilities
- [x] Document rotation procedures

### Testing
- [x] Unit: HMAC signature valid/invalid
- [x] Unit: capability gates on setting mutations
- [x] Integration (staging): OAuth2 happy-path

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Migrations & Data
- [x] Create `ai_agent_policies` (id, version, doc, ts, author)
- [x] Ensure indexes for audit/policy lookup

---

## üìä Observability & Audit
- [x] Expand `AuditLogger` to store policy version, verdict detail
- [x] Add structured error taxonomy for policy denials

---

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done
- [x] Policy engine supports time/content/rate-limit/entity approval rules
- [x] Versioned policies persisted with retrieval & diff
- [x] HMAC signing and/or OAuth2 available and documented
- [x] Unit/integration tests cover new rules and security paths
- [x] CI green and static analysis clean (PHPStan L8)

## üéâ Phase 3 Completion Summary

**Completed**: September 29, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Key Deliverables
- **Enhanced Policy Engine**: Advanced policy system with time-based restrictions, content filtering, rate limiting, approval workflows, and policy versioning
- **Security Hardening**: HMAC signing, OAuth2 integration, application passwords, and comprehensive security middleware
- **Database Enhancements**: Policy storage tables and enhanced audit logging with structured error taxonomy
- **REST API**: Complete policy management API with versioning, diff comparison, and rollback capabilities
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests covering all new security features and error paths

### Technical Achievements
- **Policy Versioning**: Full policy lifecycle management with versioning, diff comparison, and rollback
- **Multi-Auth Support**: HMAC, OAuth2, application passwords, and WordPress authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user, per-IP, and per-tool rate limiting with configurable windows
- **Content Security**: Regex-based content filtering with severity levels and blocked terms
- **Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging with structured error taxonomy and security metrics
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization middleware

### Security Features
- **Time-based Restrictions**: Working hours, blackout windows, and day-of-week restrictions
- **Content Filtering**: Regex patterns, blocked terms, and severity-based filtering
- **Rate Limiting**: Multi-dimensional rate limiting with configurable limits
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-step approval processes with condition-based triggers
- **HMAC Signing**: Request signing and verification for API security
- **OAuth2 Integration**: Full OAuth2 flow with scoped token support
- **Application Passwords**: Secure service account authentication

### Next Phase
Ready for **Phase 4: WooCommerce Integration** - Advanced e-commerce features and product management tools.
